| The addition of new features to assist administrators, teams, and your organization in scaling Jira Software allows your team to fully leverage the benefits of agile and kanban by providing them with the tools they need to develop and estimate stories quickly and efficiently, build a sprint backlog, identify team commitments and velocity, visualize team activity, and report on their progress. The accompanying guide has two courses that demonstrate a basic agile workflow at a small software company and may be used to take your team on a project tour. This tour will take you through some of the most commonly used features and will follow the Teams in Space development team as they seek to improve their next-generation space travel software. It is written in simple English.                                                                                                                                            	| Ensure that your organization's systems are always up and running, allowing people to respond to emergencies as fast as feasible. Paying a premium speeds up the procedure. Bugs and requests are submitted to the Jira Service Desk by other teams and customers. Other staff members may make hardware requests. It can, for example, accept complaints via a website or email. Users can send tickets to the Jira Service Desk for review and resolution. Unlike Jira, where everyone is required to be licensed, just your agents must be licensed. Please read the links below for some basic documentation and instructions on how to use the system. Accepting issues from others while allowing your teams to use the Jira platform is a fantastic approach to accept issues from others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	|

| Confluence is a collaboration wiki that makes it easier for teams to interact and share knowledge. It serves as your document collaboration and repository since it keeps a complete record of which documents have been edited, when they have been modified, and by whom, allowing you to keep a "audit trail." Team members can create, share, and contribute on material. The integration of Confluence and Jira Service Desk allows for the establishment of a rich knowledge base for service teams. Confluence interfaces with Jira Software and Jira Core to deliver powerful tools for project documentation, team knowledge management, requirement collecting, and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	| Bitbucket is much more than a repository management system for Git repositories.

LDAP, OpenLDAP, and Azure AD are a few examples. SSS (Single Sign-On) A single login and password are required for all programs. Single sign-on is required for Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket (SSO). They are owned by SSO. Combine directories. With a single piece of software, you can simplify user administration. A unified authentication process is feasible. Connectors for LDAP, Azure Active Directory, and Novell eDirectory. Custom connectors are an option. Collective liberties. What exactly is it? LDAP is used to manage users and their rights. Time is saved by forcing new users to join particular groups. Rebuild your system. When possible, use built-in connections such as Microsoft Azure AD or Google Apps. To construct unique connectors, developers' LDAPv3 experience must be removed. Affects how programs are executed.

# Configuring Jira

This Docker image is intended to be changed in the context of its environment; the data provided is used to generate application configuration files from templates. This permits the production and destruction of containers on-the-fly in a repeatable way, as sophisticated cluster topologies need. This method can be used to configure the majority of the deployment's configuration parameters; the required environment variables are specified below. If these parameters do not cover your specific deployment scenario, you can override them; see the section Advanced Configuration below.


# Memory / Heap Size

If you need to override Jira's default memory allocation, you can control the minimum heap (Xms) and maximum heap (Xmx) via the below environment variables.

- JVM_MINIMUM_MEMORY (default: 384m)

	- The minimum heap size of the JVM

- JVM_MAXIMUM_MEMORY (default: 768m)

	- The maximum heap size of the JVM

- JVM_RESERVED_CODE_CACHE_SIZE (default: 512m)

	- The reserved code cache size of the JVM

# Data Center configuration

This Docker image is intended to be used in conjunction with a clustered Data Center environment. Rather of manually constructing a cluster, you may launch Jira as a Data Center node by specifying the following attributes. a file that contains properties, For more information about each property and the configurations available, see Installing Jira Data Center.

# Cluster configuration

Jira Software and Jira Service Management only

	CLUSTERED (default: false)

Set to 'true' to enable the use of clustering configuration. This will produce a cluster.properties file in the $JIRA HOME directory of the container.

	JIRA_NODE_ID (default: jira_node_

The node's unique identifier. This includes a randomly generated unique identifier for each container by default, but can be modified with a custom value.

	JIRA_SHARED_HOME (default: $JIRA_HOME/shared)

The location of the Jira nodes' common home directory. Nota bene: This must be a genuine shared filesystem mounted within the container. Additionally, refer to the section on UIDs.

	EHCACHE_PEER_DISCOVERY (default: default)

Describes how nodes find each other.

	EHCACHE_LISTENER_HOSTNAME (default: NONE)

The current node's hostname for cache communication. If the parameter is not set, Jira Data Center will resolve this internally.

	EHCACHE_LISTENER_PORT (default: 40001)

The port on which the node will listen. This port may need to be exposed and published depending on your container deployment approach.

	EHCACHE_OBJECT_PORT (default: dynamic)

The port number on which the registry-bound remote objects receive calls. If not given, this defaults to a free port. This port may require exposure and publication.

	EHCACHE_LISTENER_SOCKETTIMEOUTMILLIS (default: 2000)

The Ehcache listener's default timeout.

	EHCACHE_MULTICAST_ADDRESS (default: NONE)

An address that is valid for a multicast group. When EHCACHE PEER DISCOVERY is set to 'automatic' rather than 'default', this parameter is required.

	EHCACHE_MULTICAST_PORT (default: NONE)

The dedicated heartbeat port for multicast traffic. When EHCACHE PEER DISCOVERY is set to 'automatic' rather than 'default', this parameter is required. This port may need to be exposed and published depending on your container deployment approach.

	EHCACHE_MULTICAST_TIMETOLIVE (default: NONE)

A value between 0 and 255 that specifies the maximum distance over which packets will propagate. When EHCACHE PEER DISCOVERY is set to 'automatic' rather than 'default', this parameter is required.

	EHCACHE_MULTICAST_HOSTNAME (default: NONE)

The interface's hostname or IP address for transmitting and receiving multicast packets. When EHCACHE PEER DISCOVERY is set to 'automatic' rather than 'default', this parameter is required.

# Container configuration

	SET_PERMISSIONS (default: true)

Specify whether or not the home directory's permissions are configured on startup. To disable this behavior, set it to false.

# Advanced Configuration

As previously stated, upon container initialization, the environment parameters are used to create the application configuration. However, in some cases, you may wish to alter the settings in ways that the environment variables described above do not allow. In this case, you can modify the main templates to incorporate your customized configuration. There are three basic methods for accomplishing this: by updating our repository to contain your own image, by building a new image from an existing one, or by supplying new startup templates. We will describe these tactics briefly here, but their implementation will vary according to your unique circumstances.

If your container will be persistent, you can create it, alter the templates installed in /opt/atlassian/etc/, and then launch it.

Alternatively, you can create a volume containing your custom templates and use the —volume my-config:/opt/atlassian/etc/ option to mount it over the given templates at runtime.

# Logging

By default, Jira logs are stored within the container, under the directory $JIRA HOME/logs/. If you want to expose this directory outside the container (for example, to be aggregated by the logging system), you can use a data volume or bind mount. Additionally, Tomcat logs are written to the directory /opt/atlassian/jira/logs/.

# Upgrades

To upgrade to a more recent version of Jira, simply stop the jira container and restart it with a more recent image:

	docker stop jira
	docker rm jira
	docker run ... (See above)

Because your data is kept in the host's data volume directory, it will remain accessible following the upgrade.

Please ensure that you do not use the -v option to remove the jira container and its volumes by accident.

# Backup

You can conduct evaluations using the built-in database, which will save its files in the Jira home directory. Creating a backup archive of the docker volume is adequate in this case.

If you're using an external database, you may configure Jira to automatically perform nightly backups. This will archive the current state of the jiraVolume docker volume, including the database. Alternatively, you can backup the database separately of the Jira Home directory and continue backing up the Jira Home directory using a docker volume backup archive.

Read more about data recovery and backups: https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/backing-up-data-802592964.html

# Shutdown

Jira may require a brief period of time to complete any ongoing activities before quitting, depending on your settings. The —time flag should be used to account for this when sending a docker stop.

Alternatively, the provided script /shutdown-wait.sh will do a clean shutdown and wait for the process to complete. This is the ideal method of shutting down in environments that support orderly shutdown, such as Kubernetes via the preStop hook.
